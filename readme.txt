This app has a model which has three fields
    1 :username
    2 :email
    3 :password

there is a form where users can create account , these three fields want to be unique 
for all users if a user enters any value which already exists then it will show an
error in form that this field value already exists.

For this in this project we are using ajax (fetch)
